## Assuming you've put train.csv dataset into hdfs

1. Using your container shell, create Q2 folder and go inside it:
```sh
mkdir Q2
cd Q2
```
2. Go inside your repo directory and open terminal:
```sh
cd Q2
# Copy all mapreduce and shell scripts to the namenode container's Q2 folder
docker cp ExpensiveRoutesByMonth.java namenode:/Q2/ExpensiveRoutesByMonth.java &&
docker cp TopKExpensiveRoutes.java namenode:/Q2/TopKExpensiveRoutes.java &&
docker cp run_Q2_pipeline.sh namenode:/Q2/run_Q2_pipeline.sh
docker cp run_experiments.sh namenode:/Q2/run_experiments.sh
```

3. Using namenode shell, compile the Java files using Hadoopâ€™s classpath
```sh
javac -classpath "$(hadoop classpath)" ExpensiveRoutesByMonth.java
javac -classpath "$(hadoop classpath)" TopKExpensiveRoutes.java
```

4. Create the JAR files
```sh
jar cf ExpensiveRoutesByMonth.jar ExpensiveRoutesByMonth*.class
jar cf TopKExpensiveRoutes.jar TopKExpensiveRoutes*.class
```

5. Run the MapReduce Job
```sh
./run_Q2_pipeline.sh
```
6. Run the experiments (this will output 2 csv files that you need to copy back to repo's Q2 folder for plots)
```sh
./run_experiments.sh
```
7. Copy the csv files generated back to your repo's Q2 folder
```sh
cd Q2
docker cp namenode:/Q2/reducer_experiment_results.csv ./Q2/ &&
docker cp namenode:/Q2/slowstart_experiment_results.csv ./Q2/
```
8. Visualize the experiment results
```sh
cd Q2
python plot_experiments.py
```
